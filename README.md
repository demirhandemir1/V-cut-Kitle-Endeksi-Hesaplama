# Body Mass Index Calculator

Body mass index (BMI) is calculated by dividing body mass (kg) by the square of the height in meters. Ideal weight is obtained by multiplying the desired BMI by the square of the height.

Body Mass Index (BMI) = Body Weight (kg.) / Height squared (cm.)

Ideal Weight = BMI value to be achieved * Square of height

Example Ideal Weight = 24 * (1.60 * 1.60) = 61.4 kg

I calculate body surface area with this formula: BSA = (weight 0.425 x height 0.725) x 0.007184
